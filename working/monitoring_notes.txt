In general it wouldn't hurt to read about socket handling in Python. There is a really good overview:
    https://realpython.com/python-sockets/
Also pretty good: 
    https://pymotw.com/2/select/
This is often recommended:

Consuming an event loop in zmq:

Pandastim has built-in networking features probably will be great but are poorly documented and a bit confusing:
    Examples:

nanomsg: cutting edge and has asyncio support with new libraries like trio
     https://github.com/codypiersall/pynng
     https://pynng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core.html#pynng.Sub0
OTOH: stytra uses zmq, so you should probably just use that yourself and not be a pita.

Consider using trio instead of multithreading:
