## Examples for pandastim package
https://github.com/EricThomson/pandastim/

List of examples to see how the code works or test that everything is working after initial install.

### Full field static stimuli
Nonmoving stimuli that use the `FullFieldStatic` class.
- add one
- add another

### Full field drifting stimuli
Stimuli that take up the whole panda3d window and drifts across the screen forever.
- drifting_fullfield_sin.py : drifting full-field sinusoid at arbitrary angle/velocity/frequency
- drifting_fullfield_grating.py : drifting full-field grating at arbitrary angle/velocity/frequency
- binocular sin
- binocular grating 

### Experiments
Standard trial-based structure: baseline/stimulus alternating, based on arrays of values you choose for different parameters for timing and stimulus values.
- full sin
- full grating
